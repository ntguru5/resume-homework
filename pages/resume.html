                <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
                <p>I am a recent graduate of Hack Reactor's immersive program and excited to further my growth as a software engineer. I love problem-solving and automating things in that line of work and that's part of the reason I took a liking to software development. What really fuels my passion in this field is the opportunity to make a difference. I want to create things that simplify people's lives, especially something related to animals. There's something really fulfilling about using technology to help those who can't speak for themselves. That's the kind of impact I'm striving for in my journey. <br><br>

                    I also have more than 15 years professional experience in a Network Operations Center and systems administration support in fast-paced, high availability environments. My background is in Systems Engineering with a focus on monitoring. Extensive knowledge of System Center Operations Manager, Microsoft Management technologies, Active Directory services, Windows PowerShell, Splunk Enterprise, HP SiteScope, and SolarWinds Orion.</p>
